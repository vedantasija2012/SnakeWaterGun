I have made a Snake Water and Gun game using C programming language.
Computer gives you three choices, i.e. 
1. Snake (s)
2. Water (w)
3. Gun (g)
Case 1:
If you choose s and comp chooses w, then you will win as snake drinks water.
Case 2:
If you choose w and comp chooses s, then you will loose as snake drinks water.
Case 3:
If you choose s and comp chooses g, then you will loose as gun will shoot snake.
Case 4:
If you choose g and comp chooses s, then you will win as gun will shoot snake.
Case 5:
If you choose g and comp chooses w, then you will loose as gun sinks in water.
Case 6:
If you choose w and comp chooses g, then you will win as gun sinks in water.
Case 7:
Rest are Draw conditions:
i) you = s, comp = s
ii) you = w, comp = w
iii) you = g, comp = g
